Data restoration for integration at LNLS/Pitec/Backend for aquisition
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sirius Scientific Computing Small Package for data restoration at the LNLS/Pitec/Backend

a) The geometry is previously computed in python, for a given distance between the detector and the sample. The geometry dictionary contains a LUT for mapping pixels from the acquisition domain to the restored domain

b) LUT is composed by two binary files: i) 24 x 1536 x 256 for 540D and ii) 6 x 1536 x 256 for 135D

c) Input data must be in single floating point precision
